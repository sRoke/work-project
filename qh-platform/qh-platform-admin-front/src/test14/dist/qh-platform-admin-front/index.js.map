It will be passed the\n//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\n//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n//          used to select the members to be serialized.

You can use\n//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\n//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n//          easier to read.\n\n//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n//          be used for indentation.

It receives each of the keys and values,\n//          and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n//          If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n//          If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          // Parse the text.
